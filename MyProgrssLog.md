# 100DaysOfMLCode
## This Repository contains my progress of 100 days of machine learning journey. #100daysofmlcode
### Day 0: July 6,2018


**Today's Progress**: *  I have setup the environment. Installed the Python and anaconda for the same. I have learnt about machine learning and its types. Supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised. Real life examples and applcations of ML

**Thoughts:** I am very excited at the same time i am in little doubt that will i make through this journey. I have started one udemy course to learn about ML because before digging deep into the problem i have to enhance my basic knowledge.

### Day 1: July7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: * Today, I have imported the important libraries and  required dataset. I have created DataPreproceessing 
which i am going to use in future for createing different kinds of model. key concepts i have learnt today are - Handling Missing data in the dataset, One-hot encoding and its use in ML, Euclidean distance concept. I also divided my sample data set into training and test datasets.

**Thoughts:** I have created a instagram page where i keep posted the things what i learn on daily basis. Sometimes i get demotivated beacause i am newbie in this field and there are many talented people than me but its always better to know something than nothing and with this thought i am gonna keep learning and keep posting topics on my instagram channel 100dayofmlcode.
