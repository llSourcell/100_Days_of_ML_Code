# 100 Days Of ML Code

***

### Day 0:
July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the 100 days of ML Code

**Thoughts:** I had already set myself up for coding for the last 15 days, and now I will start focusing only on machine learning to learn more about this promising field and unveil the computer's mind.

### Day 1:
09-07-2018 , 23:37

**Today's Progress:** Watched the module 10 - Introduction to Data and APIs

**Thoughts:** I am starting slowly first, focusing on learning more about data is a good way to start because a good dataset will be the main beginning to having a good model for training the algorithm later.

### Day 2:
10-07-2018 , 21:35

**Today's Progress:** Learning more about tensors - Intelligence and learning

**Thoughts:** Lazy day. Slept nothing last night and thus today was a day for me to get better and slow down. I found the Asteroids video for making a bot and I am excited to keep doing this challenge for the next week. I want to learn more about tensorflow.js, finish de api giphy project and also keep going in the tutorials and projects.

### Day 3:
11-07-2018 , 21:49

**Today's Progress:** Learned more about APIs

**Thoughts:** Today was another day were I felt some resistance. I am focusing more on letting go of things that are no longer benefiting me in order to be able to focus on this project and learn more about machine learning. I had the mentor.me idea which was very positive.

***
### Day 4:
12-07-2018 , 22:57

**Today's Progress:** Learned more about data structures

**Thoughts:** Watched some videos about binary trees, particle systems and also got to build the fireworks system uppon the physics engine that I had already made. Although this might not be directly related to ML it feels like a very nice grounding for getting deeper into ML concepts further on.

### Day 6:
14-07-2018 , 22:51

**Today's Progress:** Learning More About Genetic Algorithms

**Thoughts:** I was focused on coding for the p5-projects repo the whole day sdidn't learned much stuff directly related to Machine Learning. What I actually got to do was learn more about mathematics and trigonometry after implementing the oscillation chapter on NOC. I also watched a video about evolutionary algorithms which was very dense and explanatory. Feeling happy for today

17-07-2018 , 23:42

**Today's Progress:** Learning more about cellular automata

**Thoughts:** I is being easier to code in the midnight and i don't think this is very optimized at a long term perspective. Altho, I am being really more productive here and it's time for me to act and create a and this is what I'm currently doing. I am afraid to burn out with the coding train videos and not have a place to go for more knowledge. But these are maybe just silly concerns because he is a great mentor with lots of valuable wise videos.

### Day 50:
27-08-2018 , 21:32 

**Today's Progress:** Studied Linear Algebra

**Thoughts:** I decided to follow a 3month curriculum and instead of finishing it i will try to finish it 3 to 6 times faster. Taking all the courses as hyperproductive as I can and downloading as much information to my brain as I can. These structures are great for learning and it's all about focus.

### Day 51:
28-08-2018 , 21:17 

**Today's Progress:** Working on Linear Algebra basics

**Thoughts:** The truth is that I'm not learning much these days. But at least i'm downloading some valuable information relating to linear algebra which would be useful when trying to figure out hyperparameters later. Today is the 50 day of this challenge and I'm very proud of myself to accomplish so much in 1 and a half month. A month ago I had no idea what machinea learning was really. Artificial Intelligence is a powerful beyound-measure topic, and learning is the best shot I got to achieve freedom and move to another country which is something that I know will be an adventure for my soul. I am beginning to wake up 5am every weekday and this gives me so much time to focus on learning that in 6 months doing this I will be in a completelly new position mentally, financially and spiritually. I can commit to this only because my parents are supporting me, and this gives me space to dedicate 100% on becoming the greatest version of myself. I appreciate all that I got and yeah, dear diary, thank you.

**Today's Progress:** Linear Algebra and ML5

**Thoughts:** Today I watched 4 videos on the 3blue1brow series on liear algebra and I'm very happy to fishish reading the paper on 'the matrix calculus you need for deep learning'. It was a fun and yet challenging paper to read but I am moving forwards and this is what matters in the end.

**Today's Progress:** Very happy day. Skype call w/ Beril && lunch w/ cybelle

**Thoughts:** I am almost finishing the Series on Essence to linear algebra. Today I watched a few more videos, had the interview to learn more about the flower reality project and also had lunch with my new girl friend. Days like today feels like glory days. And I am very grateful for them. I will keep pushing forwards to learn more about machine learning and keep the momentum going. Other than that, thanks.

Machine Learning is an emerging topic with lots of potential and has yet to achieve it's peak in both technology as well as knowledge. Art is something that interests me only so much and mixing both is how I find myself being drawn to.
