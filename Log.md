# 100 Days Of ML Code

***

### Day 0:
July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the 100 days of ML Code

**Thoughts:** I had already set myself up for coding for the last 15 days, and now I will start focusing only on machine learning to learn more about this promising field and unveil the computer's mind.

### Day 1:
09-07-2018 , 23:37

**Today's Progress:** Watched the module 10 - Introduction to Data and APIs

**Thoughts:** I am starting slowly first, focusing on learning more about data is a good way to start because a good dataset will be the main beginning to having a good model for training the algorithm later.

### Day 2:
10-07-2018 , 21:35

**Today's Progress:** Learning more about tensors - Intelligence and learning

**Thoughts:** Lazy day. Slept nothing last night and thus today was a day for me to get better and slow down. I found the Asteroids video for making a bot and I am excited to keep doing this challenge for the next week. I want to learn more about tensorflow.js, finish de api giphy project and also keep going in the tutorials and projects.

### Day 3:
11-07-2018 , 21:49

**Today's Progress:** Learned more about APIs

**Thoughts:** Today was another day were I felt some resistance. I am focusing more on letting go of things that are no longer benefiting me in order to be able to focus on this project and learn more about machine learning. I had the mentor.me idea which was very positive.

***
### Day 4:
12-07-2018 , 22:57

**Today's Progress:** Learned more about data structures

**Thoughts:** Watched some videos about binary trees, particle systems and also got to build the fireworks system uppon the physics engine that I had already made. Although this might not be directly related to ML it feels like a very nice grounding for getting deeper into ML concepts further on.

### Day 5:
13-07-2018 , 22:08

**Today's Progress:** Learning More About A* Pathfinding Algorithm

**Thoughts:** It's going solid so far. Learning about algorithms is the first part of how I'm planning to work with data. I will start implementing these thing into code and then progress trough the whole data thing.

### Day 6:
14-07-2018 , 22:51

**Today's Progress:** Learning More About Genetic Algorithms

**Thoughts:** I was focused on coding for the p5-projects repo the whole day sdidn't learned much stuff directly related to Machine Learning. What I actually got to do was learn more about mathematics and trigonometry after implementing the oscillation chapter on NOC. I also watched a video about evolutionary algorithms which was very dense and explanatory. Feeling happy for today

### Day 9:
17-07-2018 , 23:42

**Today's Progress:** Learning more about cellular automata

**Thoughts:** I is being easier to code in the midnight and i don't think this is very optimized at a long term perspective. Altho, I am being really more productive here and it's time for me to act and create a and this is what I'm currently doing. I am afraid to burn out with the coding train videos and not have a place to go for more knowledge. But these are maybe just silly concerns because he is a great mentor with lots of valuable wise videos.

### Day 10:
18-07-2018 , 19:48

**Today's Progress:** Starting to read Luan's Tcc

**Thoughts:** Luan was a roomate when I was at FGA. He wrote a very good article about Machine Learning, Clusterization, the impact of algorithms on thlitics and democracy and how to use a smart approach on social discussions. I am beggining to read his 80-pg long final project and learn more about the in depth details of the problem and its sulution.

**Thoughts:** Today I worked on myself. Learning more, canceling out the noise, listening to myself and honoring my own needs. I am slowly stepping into the direction of all the things I want and need. I am grateful for what I got. If I get more it's a bonus, but I'm content. I'm choosing this ml lifestyle and this is a sign that the focus is helping me. This is radical action and every single day I am waking up and doing stuff. Making it happening.
